# Graph Visualization Program

## Introduction

This program is designed to visualize undirected graphs and create a BMP image representation of the graph.

## Features

- Visualizes undirected graphs with nodes and edges.
- Writes node IDs on the graph image.
- Supports BMP image format.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
